The above code was executed succesfully on both Codechef IDE and Coding Blocks IDE.

The content of the inputFile1.txt is:

5
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 4 5
4 5 3
5 -1 2
3

Here, number 5 at the top represents that there are 5 nodes in the original linked list.
Then 5 lines follows, in which, numbers are written in the format:
<node number> <first pointer> <second pointer>
-1 means that the corresponding pointer is NULL.

At the end number 3 is there. It means that node 3 has to be deleted from the duplicate linked list.
